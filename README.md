# JP_Morgan_Virtual_Experience
This repository contains my completed tasks for the **JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research job simulation** hosted on Forage. The project covered real-world problems related to risk modeling, pricing, and credit rating systems used in financial services.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Gas Storage Pricing Model
- Built a Python function to simulate and price gas storage contracts.
- Considered injection/withdrawal schedules, capacity, rate limits, and storage costs.
- Estimated net present value assuming no interest rate or delay.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA
- Explored raw data to assess delinquency risk.
- Cleaned inconsistencies, checked for nulls, and performed visual EDA.
- Helped identify signals useful for future default prediction.

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Probability of Default (PD) Model
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict loan default.
- Calculated expected loss using PD and a recovery rate.

---

### 🔹 Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing (Quantization)
- Implemented MSE-based bucketing using KMeans strategy.
- Grouped FICO scores into 5 rating buckets (1 = best, 5 = worst).
- Outlined log-likelihood-based bucketing approach using dynamic programming.

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## 📁 Dataset
The loan data used for Task 3 & 4 is available in the dataset/ folder:
